        text: `You have the right to work, but for the work’s sake only. You have no right to the fruits of work.<br><br>Desire for the fruits of work must never be your motive in working.

Renounce attachment to the fruits.<br><br>Be even-tempered in success and failure; for it is this evenness of temper which is meant by yoga.<br><br>Work done with anxiety about results is far inferior to work done without such anxiety, in the calm of self-surrender.
