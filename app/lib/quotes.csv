"Bhagavad Ghita","You have the right to work, but for the work's sake only. You have no right to the fruits of work. Desire for the fruits of work must never be your motive in working. Never give way to laziness, either. Perform every action with your heart fixed on the Supreme Lord. Renounce attachment to the fruits. Be even-tempered in success and failure; for it is this evenness of temper which is meant by yoga. Work done with anxiety about results is far inferior to work done without such anxiety, in the calm of self-surrender. Seek refuge in the knowledge of Brahman. They who work selfishly for results are miserable."
"Voltaire","If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him."

"Lemony Snicket","How to write a good thank you note 1. Do not start with the thank you. 2. Start with any other sentence. If you first say, 'Thank you for the nice sweater,' you can't imagine what to write next. Say, 'It was so wonderful to come home from school to find this nice sweater. Thank you for thinking of me on Arbor Day.' 3. Then you're done. I recommend learning how to write a very good thank-you note. A child who can write a nice thank-you note can turn into a cocaine dealer five years later and be remembered as the child who wrote nice thank-you notes."
"Hermann Hesse, Siddhartha","The men of the world were equal to the thinkers in every other respect and were often superior to them, just as animals in their tenacious undeviating actions in cases of necessity may often seem superior to human beings."
Bret Victor,"The most dangerous thought that you can have as a creative person is to think that you know what you're doing, because once you think you know what you're doing you stop looking around for other ways of doing things and you stop being able to see other ways of doing things."
